Purpose of code: implements a two layer fully connected neural network and test it out on the CIFAR-10 dataset
How to run this code: run by jupyter. To run correctly, it requires that every folder and every file should be in right directory
parameter: refer to the comments in .py codes
result: refer to ./two_layer_net(result).pdf

./neural_net.py: include TwoLayerNet class and some functions that are needed in two_layer_net.ipynb
./two_layer_net.ipynb: implement and test the two layer net
./two_layer_net.py: same with two_layer_net.ipynb (different extension)
